Steps for Ugali:\r\nBring the water and salt to a boil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir in the cornmeal slowly, letting it fall through the fingers of your hand.\r\n\r\n3. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue stirring regularly, smashing any lumps with a spoon, until the mush pulls away from the sides of the pot and becomes very thick, about 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4.Remove from heat and allow to cool.\r\n\r\n5. Place the ugali into a large serving bowl. Wet your hands with water, form a ball and serve.\r\n\r\n6. Steps for Kachumbari: Mix the tomatoes, onions, chili and coriander leaves in a bowl.\r\n\r\n7.
