  "instructions": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the [INGREDIENT:d74fdde2:singular] in a medium-size saucepan and place over a medium heat. Add the [INGREDIENT:cf4c2232:singular] and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Add the [INGREDIENT:96518056:plural] to the saucepan with the onions.\r\n\r\nOnce the [INGREDIENT:cf4c2232:singular] and [INGREDIENT:96518056:plural] are almost cooked, stir in the flour – this will make a thick paste called a roux. If you are using a stock cube, crumble the cube into the roux now and stir well. Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously for 2 mins – this will cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury taste.\r\n\r\nTake the roux off the heat. Slowly add the fresh stock, if using, or pour in 500ml water if you’ve used a stock cube, stirring all the time. Once all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of [INGREDIENT:3d7d2015:singular] and [INGREDIENT:4877baa5:singular]. Put the saucepan back onto a medium heat and slowly bring it to the boil, stirring all the time. Once the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Add the cooked [INGREDIENT:742929dc:singular] and vegetables to the sauce and stir well. Grease a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little [INGREDIENT:d74fdde2:singular] and pour in the [INGREDIENT:742929dc:singular] and mushroom filling.\r\n\r\nCarefully lay the [INGREDIENT:e1a1f0be:plural] on top of the hot-pot filling, overlapping them slightly, almost like a pie top.\r\n\r\nBrush the [INGREDIENT:e1a1f0be:plural] with a little melted [INGREDIENT:d74fdde2:singular] and cook in the oven for about 35 mins. The hot-pot is ready once the [INGREDIENT:e1a1f0be:plural] are cooked and golden brown.",
