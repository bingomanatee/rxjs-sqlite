  "instructions": "Rinse the [INGREDIENT:0940caca:plural] in several changes of cold water and drain well. Tip the [INGREDIENT:0940caca:plural] into a large pan with 500ml of water. Cover, bring to the boil and simmer for 2 mins until the [INGREDIENT:0940caca:plural] have just opened. Tip the contents of the pan into a colander over a bowl to catch the clam stock. When cool enough to handle, remove the [INGREDIENT:0940caca:plural] from their shells – reserving a handful of empty shells for presentation if you want. Strain the clam stock into a jug, leaving any grit in the bottom of the bowl. You should have around 800ml stock.\r\nHeat the [INGREDIENT:d74fdde2:singular] in the same pan and sizzle the [INGREDIENT:7813258e:singular] for 3-4 mins until it starts to brown. Stir in the [INGREDIENT:cf4c2232:singular], [INGREDIENT:306c0a0e:singular] and bay and cook everything gently for 10 mins until the [INGREDIENT:cf4c2232:singular] is soft and golden. Scatter over the flour and stir in to make a sandy paste, cook for 2 mins more, then gradually stir in the clam stock then the [INGREDIENT:ecbdb882:singular] and the cream.\r\nThrow in the [INGREDIENT:e1a1f0be:plural], bring everything to a simmer and leave to bubble away gently for 10 mins or until the [INGREDIENT:e1a1f0be:plural] are cooked. Use a fork to crush a few of the potato chunks against the side of the pan to help thicken – you still want lots of defined chunks though. Stir through the clam meat and the few clam shells, if you've gone down that route, and simmer for a minute to reheat. Season with plenty of black pepper and a little salt, if needed, then stir through the [INGREDIENT:ad74d421:singular] just before ladling into bowls or hollowed-out crusty rolls.",
